Code Documentation Style
========================
In this project, we follow professional commenting practices that focus on clarity and purpose:

1. Comments explain "why" decisions were made, not "what" the code does
2. We document:
   - Design decisions and trade-offs
   - Non-obvious technical choices
   - Important implementation rationale
3. We avoid:
   - Comments that merely describe the code
   - Redundant class/method documentation when names are self-explanatory
   - Over-commenting obvious operations
