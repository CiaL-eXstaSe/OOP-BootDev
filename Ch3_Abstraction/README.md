CHAPTER 3: ABSTRACTION

===================
Learning Objectives
===================
- Understanding abstraction and its role in OOP
- Learning the distinction between abstraction and encapsulation
- Practicing abstraction implementation in Python
- Creating clean interfaces for complex behaviors
- Managing class state and behavior appropriately

=====
Notes
=====
- Abstraction creates simple interfaces for complex behavior
- Encapsulation focuses on hiding internal implementation details
- Both concepts work together in practice
- Functions are a common form of abstraction
- Complex operations can be simplified through abstraction
- Internal implementation can change without affecting interface
- Good abstractions make code more maintainable
- Poor abstractions can lead to system-wide issues
- Changing abstractions requires careful consideration
- Random number generation is a practical example of abstraction
