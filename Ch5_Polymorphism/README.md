CHAPTER 5: POLYMORPHISM

===================
Learning Objectives
===================
- Understanding polymorphism and its role in OOP
- Implementing method overriding in Python
- Working with operator overloading
- Overriding built-in Python methods
- Creating flexible and reusable class interfaces
- Building complex game mechanics using polymorphic behavior

=====
Notes
=====
- Polymorphism allows variables, functions, or objects to take multiple forms
- Method overriding enables child classes to modify parent class behavior
- Operator overloading customizes how operators work with custom classes
- Built-in methods like __str__ and __repr__ can be overridden
- Polymorphism promotes code flexibility and reusability
- Complex game mechanics can be simplified through polymorphic design
- Rectangle overlap detection demonstrates practical polymorphism
- Card game implementations showcase operator overloading
