# Chapter 2: Encapsulation

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding encapsulation and data hiding principles
- Implementing private attributes using double underscores
- Creating getter methods for controlled access
- Managing public vs private members
- Protecting object state through encapsulation
- Building robust class interfaces

## Notes
- Encapsulation hides complexity inside a "black box"
- Functions are a basic form of encapsulation
- All properties and methods are public by default in Python
- Private members are prefixed with double underscores (__)
- Private members help hide implementation details
- Derived properties can be calculated from private base attributes
- Public interfaces should be stable and well-defined
- Private members can be changed without affecting external code
- Getters provide controlled access to private data
- Input validation helps maintain object state integrity
