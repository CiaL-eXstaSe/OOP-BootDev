# OOP-BootDev

A comprehensive course on Object-Oriented Programming principles and implementation in Python.

===================
Course Description
===================
This course provides a deep dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, with practical implementations in Python. Through a series of chapters, lessons, and hands-on challenges, you'll learn how to design and build robust, maintainable software using OOP principles.

===================
Learning Objectives
===================
- Master fundamental OOP concepts and principles
- Write clean, maintainable, and reusable code
- Implement the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Design effective class hierarchies and relationships
- Create robust and flexible software systems
- Apply OOP patterns to solve real-world programming challenges

==============
Course Content
==============
Chapter 1: Classes
-----------------
- OOP fundamentals and clean code principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) implementation
- Class creation and object instantiation
- Methods, constructors, and object state management
- Class vs Instance variables
- Practical applications through game development and management systems

Chapter 2: Encapsulation
-----------------------
- Data hiding and access control
- Private attributes implementation
- Getter methods and controlled access
- Public vs private member management
- State protection through encapsulation
- Real-world applications in banking and education systems

Chapter 3: Abstraction
---------------------
- Interface simplification for complex behaviors
- Distinction between abstraction and encapsulation
- Clean interface design
- State and behavior management
- Practical implementations in gaming and card systems
- Random number generation and mathematical operations

Chapter 4: Inheritance
---------------------
- Parent-child class relationships
- Inheritance hierarchies and method access
- Private property management across inheritance chains
- Multiple child class implementations
- Game unit system design
