# Chapter 1: Classes

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming
- Learning the importance of clean code and naming conventions
- Implementing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Creating and working with Python classes
- Understanding methods, constructors, and object instances
- Managing object state and behavior
- Working with multiple objects and their interactions

## Notes
- OOP is a pattern for writing clean and maintainable code
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- DRY principle helps avoid code repetition
- Classes are custom types that can store properties and methods
- Methods are functions tied to a class with access to its properties
- The `self` parameter in methods refers to the instance of the class
- Constructors (`__init__`) initialize object properties
- Objects are instances of classes with unique states
- Methods can modify object state and return values
- Exception handling is important for robust class design
- Class variables are shared across all instances of a class
- Instance variables are unique to each object instance
- It's generally better to use instance variables over class variables
- Different programming languages use different terms for these concepts
